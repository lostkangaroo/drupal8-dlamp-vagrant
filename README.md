vagrant
=======

Quick repo to allow for this environment to be built.  Standby for super cool stuff if your interested.

Integrates with PHPStorm at the moment by setting two environment variables without which can cause some issues.  This should be fixed fairly soon.  Also requires the vagrant-omnibus plugin so ensure chef is fully upgraded.

Adds Drush, Composer, and Git support

Special Thanks to Neclimdul, and Emma Jane Westby
